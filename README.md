A chess engine that I'm currently working on in python. 

My goal is to use the lessons I've learned in a previous project (which is currently private) from the start to have a clear and easily maintained code base by relying on OOP and type hinting. 

Currently its a work in progress. 
I still need to implement:
- The king piece
- Check and Checkmate
- A UI
- A main loop that allows two players to play against each other on the same computer.
